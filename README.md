# Development Cycle

## Branches

Two main branches will represent the stable builds of the site and the alpha/beta build.

- Master (Stable Branch)
- Development (Alpha Branch)

We will add a new branch for each feature we want to add, trying to make them as specific and small as possible.

The feature branch will be added to development to check how the new features integrate with what is already being built and on the end of a cycle (1~4 features) they will merge with the master one.

We could have a pre-stable branch to use as beta and keep development as alpha.
